#+BEGIN_VERSE
When K. arrived, it was late in the night,
The village was covered under deep snow,
And the castle hill was nowhere in sight.
Fog and darkness enveloped him and though
The sky's faintest glow of light could not show
The outline of the great Palace, K. stood
On the wooden bridge, the darkness below,
The seeming emptiness was understood
To offer our hero the start of something good.

#+begin_verse
And then, a decisive intake of air,
K. descended to the village below
Hoping to find lodgings anywhere there.
In the inn, peasants still stirred to and fro
In spite of the hour. There were no rooms, though
The Innkeeper offered a sack of straw,
And K.'s weariness had brought him so low
That he eagerly accepted as fair
The innkeeper's offer to sleep on the floor there.
#+end_verse

<2024-02-13 Tue>
#+begin_verse
But soon then K. was roused from his slumber
By a young man with a thespian's face.
The peasants were still there too in number
And many had turned from their beer in case
An entertaining spectacle took place.
The young man was dressed in fancy city
Clothes; his eyes were narrowed; it seemed the case
The young man was the son of a pretty
Big deal, and he was not trying to be witty!
#+end_verse

<2024-02-20 Tue>
#+begin_verse
A big deal indeed, the son of the Palace
Steward stood over K., his eyebrows strong,
Ready to torment with polite malice
Our poor K. over his excursion along
The village's outskirts lurking among
The shadows and darkness of the late hour.
You have entered the village was his song,
And the right to stay in any bower
Or hut, resided only in Count Westwest's power.

#+begin_verse
Half sitting up and straightening his hair
K. nonchalantly glanced up at the crowd;
The innkeeper, the peasants in their chairs,
The young man asking if K. should be allow'd,
All waiting there for K. to speak out loud
His intentions on such a snowy night.
"Where am I?" K. asked as if he were proud
of his ignorance,  "I'm lost in the night."
He cried, "Palace you say? But there was not one in sight."

<2024-03-02 Sat>
#+begin_verse
The young man was astonished by K.'s act,
"Why indeed, the Palace of Count Westwest!"
"And you need the Count's permission, in fact,
For a weary travellor to simply rest
Overnight?" asked K. upon being press'd
By the expecting crowd. Was it a dream
That gave to him the notion that a guest
Could be so cruelly turned out? It did seem
To beggar belief. Such cruelty K. could not gleam.

#+begin_verse
"You must have permission!" was the reply.
And with that, the dramatic young man turn'd
To his audience, and said with a sigh,
"Or maybe it's not required to have earn'd
The Count's blessings!" And now having so learn'd
The conditions of discretely dwelling
overnight, grasping that which so concern'd
the crowd, K. yawned, and perhaps overselling
his nonchalance, announced his plans without yelling.

"Now, if it is permission that I need,"
Said K. "Then it is permission I seek."
And as if he were about to proceed,
Cast off his blanket with nary a peek
At the shocked crowd, barely able to speak.
"Permission from whom?" sputtered the young man,
"At this midnight hour?" he said with a shreik.
"It isn't possible?" and K. began
To yawn, "Why did you wake up a slumbering man?"

#+begin_verse
The young man was beside himself with rage,
"Why you're not but a low-down dirty bum!"
With a passion found only on the stage.
"The count demands respect! Not some sass from
A common tramp who's lower than pond scum!
You must depart the count's territory
At once!" At this, K. was able to drum
Up the peace of a saint in God's glory
"Enough!" he said and K. then began his story.
#+end_verse

* Interlude
#+begin_verse
Does K. feel despair? Does he cry in the night?
Is he so fixated on his mission
That he no longer dreads the morning light?
Why has he come here without permission?
Travelled so far on this expedition
Without a companion to help him through
The snow and darkness with precision.
Where is his family? Are they so few
That K. was attracted to the palace in view?

"I've had enough of your nonsense." said K,
"The Innkeeper and these good gentlemen
Are my witnesses should I need to sway
A jury of my peers. I take it then
You would like to know why I am here in
Your village. I am the land surveyor
Sent for by the Count. Now there, you see when
I saw the snow, layer upon layer,
I sat out on the trek after a hopeful prayer.

"But, unfortunately, I lost my way
More than a few times and arrived so late
That I knew it was too late in the day
To report to the Palace in my state.
This is why I chose to accept my fate
And make do with camping out on the floor
Here in the corner. As much as I hate
To give up the comforts of a locked door
And a sweet bed, I knew my sleep would not be poor."

"Tommorrow my assistants will arrive
Via carriage with the equipment in tow.
Now that's all that I'm willing to contrive
As far as an explanation will go.
Now goodnight fellas and, please, go pound snow!"
K. turned to the stove and pulled his blanket tight.
The Inn's mob retreated after K.'s show,
Confused by this information's new light,
They conversed in hushed tones while keeping K.in sight.

"Surveyor?" the word was tossed back and forth,
And then a silence fell over the mob.
The young man, eager to show off his worth,
And now determined to finish the job,
Whispered in a tone so as not to rob
K. of his sleep but loud enough to hear
"I'll call the Palace, ask about this slob,
And check his story." he said with a sneer.
He headed to the phone and brought it close to his ear.

"Good Goddamn!" thought K. to himself, "This place
Is decked out to the nines! They have a phone?"
Said telephone was crowded in a space
Directly above K.'s head. In his own
Weariness, among them all, he was alone
In overlooking the infernal thing.
Now K.'s restful sleep was sure to be blown
By the eager fellow's attempt to ring
The Palace. And now poor K. had to hear him sing.

Then the question was, would K. allow it?
He decided to allow it, but now
It was the case he could find no merit
In feigning sleep, he flipped o'er with a scow
And waited for the young man to find how
To inquire without disrupting K.'s sleep.
Across the way the dim light did allow
K. to see the bauern together deep
In discussion, in a corner, piled in a heap.

K.'s arrival was no trivial news.
Surveyors don't pop up every day!
Every landlord had something to lose
If the Count changed the lines any old way.
The kitchen door was opened all the way,
And its frame filled by the landlady's form.
The host, eager to report on the fray,
Tiptoed in her direction to inform
The mighty Landlady of the incoming storm.

The telephone conversation began.
The Palace Governor was sound asleep,
But one of his lackeys was the night man,
A certain Herr Fritz, who was known to keep
Some abysmally late hours sometimes deep
Into the night, was awake. The young man,
Going by Schwarzer, proceeded to leap
Into how he had found K., worn and wan,
Sleeping on a dirty straw sack, so he began.

Of course, Schwarzer was suspicious of him!
The landlord had neglected his duty;
And so the burden was his to, with grim
Determination, check out K.'s beauty
Of a tale. Awakening K.'s booty 
From a deep sleep, his interrogation
Of the man while he endured K.s snooty
Attitude, and threw his accusation
At K., along with expulsion from the nation.

Schwarzer was shocked by K's ingratitude.
Perhaps rightly so, since K. claimed to be
A surveyor appointed to the good
By the Count his very own self and we
Can all assume that it's Scwarzer's duty
To verify K.'s claim, and so for sure
He was going to ask this Fritz to see
Into K.'s claim, that the Count did procure
His services, and of his motives, were they pure?

And then all was quiet. The whole lot of them
Waited with bated breath for Fritz to return
With the Palace's answer, a precious gem
Of information, so that they might learn
Could they send K. flying out with a stern
Flogging? And K.? He kept his poker face
Firmly intact and determined to earn
His spot with the rats in the Palace's race.
He stayed stoic, steadfast; his mask firmly in place.

Soon the phone's bray cut through the quiet.
It was Fritz, his report musta been brief
For Schwarzer, as if to start a riot,
Shouted, "I told you so!" in stark relief
And slammed down the receiver, "A liar-in-chief!
Nobody has heard of this surveyor!"
K. dove under his blanket in the belief
That Schwarzer, bauren, and everyone there
Would pounce upon poor K. right there without a care.

<2024-12-15 Sun>
#+begin_verse
He waited for the assault with unease,
Under the blanket K. said a small prayer,
When the phone rang again it seemed to squeeze
the soul out of poor K. as he lay there.
He slowly poked his head out, with great care
And then watched Schwarzer return to the phone,
Meekly allowing the caller to share
A long story that led Schwarzer to groan,
"Mistake? How can I explain this all on my own?"

"This puts me in quite a pickle, you know,
And the office manager made the call?"
K. listened to this telephonic show
With great interest. Had the Palace all
but yielded to K. without even a brawl?
K. felt hope, saw light where there was no light
Before. Was the Palace totally in thrall
To its own power that it had lost sight
Of the freedom that K. would enjoy in the fight?

But then, K. began to reflect again,
Perhaps the keen Palace had taken stock
Of him and, finding him wanting, had then
Likened him to Sisyphus and his rock,
A sad figure racing against the clock,
Suddenly the Palace had, with a smile,
Taken up the struggle to perhaps block
K.; His effort to join the village while
Enjoying a Palace job and living in style.

Someone told falsehoods about Joseph K.
And as he lay in a peaceful slumber,
Strange men arrested him that faithful day.
It was not his choice to pluck a number
From a ticket dispenser and lumber
To the back of the line. He did not choose
To embrace the law that would encumber
His efforts, leading Joseph K. to lose
His own life to two men in fading twilight hues.

But, what can be said then of our poor K.?
He certainly chose his peculiar fate,
Groveling for a position all day,
Every day, no matter how small or great.
Sleeping away by the palace's gate
And prostrating himself before the law
Seasons will pass and K. will track the date
Until he is robbed of all that he saw
And is found dead in the winter's
And his poor body is found in the springtime's thaw

Schwarzer approached K. bowing and scraping,
But K. only shooed him off on his way.
K. was offered a chance of escaping
The pub for the innkeeper's room til day,
But K. shook his head and would only say
To bring a washbasin with soap and towel
Items the landlady brought right away.
The lamp was darkened, with a nary a growl
From the bauren as they left K. with the night owl.

Well for good work? I would be mighty sore
If this weren't true, leaving my family and more."

We perch on a distant promontory,
And can no longer see what was once known.

An idea left rotting in a hovel,
Never to know, no matter how much we grovel.

K. rose from his seat; he had done his best 
To set the Wirt at ease, but now the rest 
Of his day needed to begin. As he

Figure of a man on the wall caught the

The half-length portrait was of a spirit,
'Bout fifty years of age, with a forehead
So ponderous and so heavy that it
Seemed to depress his chin, it could be said,
Into his chest. His head was sunk so it  
Was nigh impossible to see his eyes. 
His hand clutched his thick hair as if unfit
To support a head that could not arise -
Like Lazarus from the grave, to its former size.

As K. was going out he noticed a dark portrait in a dim frame on the wall. He had already (schon)
observed it from his couch (Lager) by the stove, but from that distance he had not been able to
distinguish any details and had thought that it was only a plain back to the frame. But it was a
picture after all, as now appeared, the bust portrait of a man about fifty. His head was sunk so low
upon his breast that his eyes were scarcely visible, and the weight of the high, heavy forehead and
the strong hooked nose seemed to have borne the head down. Because of this pose the man's full beard
was pressed in at the chin and spread out farther down. His left hand was spread out in his thick
hair but could no longer support his head.

But, you see, I'm not as honest as you,

In the kitchen with her elbows sticking
Out and decided that he need not chase
The matter any further. Heels clicking,

The Palace was framed against the clear air,
And it loomed above the village below.
It met K's expectations hanging there.
It was not some musty old castle, oh
No! Nor an ornate building just for show,
But rather a jumble of squat buildings,
With only one tower K. could not know
If it was a church without the gilding
But alas, naming such things he was not skilled in.

On the Palace. But as our K. came near
The sight of the Palace began to spread
Out before him; he was struck by a fear.
It was not grandiose vision, that was clear,
Rather a miserable little town
Assembled from stone houses in such a queer
Manner. A wave of displeasure crashed down
Upon him. How could this place command such renown?
